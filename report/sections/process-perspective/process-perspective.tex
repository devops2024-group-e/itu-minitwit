\subsection{Monitoring and logging}
For monitoring we use Grafana. Our board shows requests duration, errors rate, top 10 unhandled exception endpoints and more (for visualization of the board, see appendix \ref{appendix:grafana}). We have used the board to get an overview of where to put our focus, ie. which endpoints to improve, which errors to fix, etc. Moreover, we have gained insights into the health of the system and gotten an impression of how the backend and frontend handle the requests.

For logging, we use Grafana and Loki. It seemed obvious to continue our work with Grafana in order to keep the system setup as simple as possible. The logs are divided into Information, Warning, Debug and Error. All logging statements are placed in the controllers, such that we have information about the users' whereabouts in the system. For example, we log when a user logins whether successful or unsuccessful.
