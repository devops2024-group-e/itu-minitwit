\section{System's Perspective}

\subsection{Design and Architecture}
Figure \ref{fig:systemoverview} provides an overview of our system infrastructure:

\end{figure}
The system includes a single Virtual Private Network with an IP range 192.168.1.0/24. Within this network, we operate a database cluster consisting of a single node. This node is connected to the Docker Swarm cluster, featuring both a manager and a worker node.

Both our monitoring and cluster servers are visibly exposed to the internet. Additionally, the database server is accessible from the internet, but has a constraint of only talking to our servers and therefore not accept requests from any other host.

\subsection{Interactions of Subsystems}
Our system consists of two main subsystems, namely the REST SimulatorAPI and the webapplication Minitwit. As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:subsystem-interaction}, the SimulatorAPI and Minitwit subsystems are similar in structure. However, when looking at the processes behind the structures in Figure \ref{fig:frontend-interaction} and \ref{fig:backend-interaction}, it is apparant that these two differ a great deal.

    \end{center}
    \caption{An overview of the subsystems and how they interact}
    \label{fig:subsystem-interaction}
\end{figure}

Because the two main subsystems are inherently different, we wanted to implement a database abstraction layer such that we had a uniform way of querying the database. Therefore, both controllers use the Repository package from the subsystem Minitwit.Infrastructure to query the database using the Repository pattern\cite{repo_pattern}.
%cite
Due to the different specifications for the Minitwit and SimulatorAPI, the controller for Minitwit is more complex. As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:frontend-interaction}, the controller for Minitwit has to present information in a GUI, whereas the SimulatorAPI only calls the repository to fetch the user messages, as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:backend-interaction}.

\subsection{Current State}
Table \ref{current-table} describes the status of the system after the simulator has been shut down.

            \hline
            Total requests & 34233 \\
            \hline

Furthermore, the static analysis tool SonarCloud assesses that the quality of the overall code is good (see appendix \ref{appendix:sonarcloud}).
